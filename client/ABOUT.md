# The points

The points is a turn based strategy game.

## Rules

Each turn, players increase one of the counters of the cell on which they are present by one. If the field cell counter exceeds three, then cell division will occur. As a result, four adjacent cells will be occupied by the player whose cell is divided. To win, you need to be the last player on the playing field.
